# My Random Password Generator

## Description

- I love brain teasers and finding new ways to have math work at random. I found this one extremely fun!
- I created this generator to show my ability to create specific perameters in a mix use case that has multpile uses.
- I desided to create to great this generator because I wanted to give users a different take on a simple password generator tool.
- By making this page, I learned the importance of structoring your Javascript and how each line can ultimitley affect the program as a whole.
